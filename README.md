# Learnig Vue.js

This is a study repository for Vue.js, where new lesson files will be added for each new course section. The repository is organized by topics of the course, it is possible that there are some variables and comments written in Portuguese, as this repository is for personal study, I did not find it necessary to translate. But feel free to review and use the code :)
